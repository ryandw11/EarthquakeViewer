Earthquake Viewer shows recent earthquakes that have occured on Earth. Earthquakes appear as a red-dot at the location of the epicenter.
This program also acts as a demo for the [Kakara Engine](https://github.com/kakaragame/Engine).   
  
This program is still in active development and will improve over time.
